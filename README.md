![Page Image](./public/images/dragdrop_tabs.png)

## Purpose

This is an app I created as a proof of concept to demonstrate the use of:</p>

_This tool is built using the following:_

- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery's sortable
- Modular Sass

## Working Demo

http://dragdroptabs.jeffolivier.codes

### If you have a website that needs to have it's tabs changed regularly, or if you need have different tabs for different versions of your wbesite, then this is the tool for you.

## How to use this app

**Green tabs** will be shown on only the mobile-sized (whatever you determine) screen widths of your site<br>
**Blue tabs** will be shown on all screen widths of your site<br>
**gray tabs** are additional ones that you can add to your menu

The **Save Tab Options** button only becomes **_active_** when there is an actual change to be saved.

- You can rearrange the order that the tabs are shown in, then hit save
- You can move a tab that is being used to the white box to remove it from being seen/used
- You can add a new tab to your menu by grabbing a gray one in the white area and moving it inline with the green/blue icons
- You can not edit the name of each individual tab
