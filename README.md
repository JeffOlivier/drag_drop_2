## If you have a website that needs to have it's tabs changed regularly, or if you need have different tabs for different versions of your wbesite, then this is the tool for you.

_This tool is built using **JavaScript ES6**, **jQuery**, and **SASS**._

**Green tabs** will be shown on only the mobile-sized (whatever you determine) screen widths of your site<br>
**Blue tabs** will be shown on all screen widths of your site<br>
**gray tabs** are additional ones that you can add to your menu

The **Save Tab Options** button only becomes **_active_** when there is an actual change to be saved.

- You can rearrange the order that the tabs are shown in, then hit save
- You can move a tab that is being used to the white box to remove it from being seen/used
- You can add a new tab to your menu by grabbing a gray one in the white area and moving it inline with the green/blue icons
- You can not edit the name of each individual tab
